## sched ##
A simple scheduler for Arduino, written in C.

### Wait, what? ###
This is a non-preemptive scheduler that I wrote in a few hours (and then
improved over a week) in order to schedule tasks to play on an Arduino nicely.

There's also a [blog post](https://www.cyphar.com/blog/post/making-a-simple-scheduler-for-arduino)
about it, explaining how it works and why it exists.
